## Description

The Simulated Annealing for the Traveling Salesman Problem (SA-TSP) project is an immersive journey into the captivating world of metaheuristics, focusing on the classic optimization challenge of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This project implements a simulated annealing algorithm that incorporates weighted neighborhood operations and multiple neighborhood operations to find near-optimal solutions efficiently.

Key features from the implementation:
1. **Initial Solution Generation**: A random initial solution is created by shuffling city coordinates while ensuring the start point is fixed and the route returns to the origin.
2. **Fitness Evaluation and Distance Calculation**: An efficient fitness function calculates the total route distance using a precomputed distance matrix between all city pairs, guiding the optimization process.
3. **Advanced Neighborhood Operations**: Implements a variety of weighted operators, including swap, insert, inverse subroutes, and insert subroutes to generate neighboring solutions. These operations are applied iteratively and adjusted dynamically based on the system's temperature, enabling a nuanced exploration of the solution space.
4. **Cooling Schedule**: Utilizes an exponential decay function to methodically reduce the temperature, systematically decreasing the probability of accepting worse solutions over time.
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Probabilistically accepts new solutions based on their fitness and the system's temperature to balance exploration with the goal of finding an optimal solution.

## Results

Our simulated annealing algorithm was tested against well-established benchmarks from TSPLIB. The performance metrics on benchmarks such as `ulysses22.tsp`, `berlin52.tsp`, `st70.tsp`, and `ch130.tsp` demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- The results highlight the importance of selecting the right parameters for simulated annealing and neighborhood strategy.

The following graph illustrates the convergence pattern of the algorithm over iterations for a selected benchmark:
